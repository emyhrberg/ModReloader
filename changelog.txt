v1.1:
- Added better player & world config selection with previews
- Added preprocessor directive option called "Debug Reload" in config (thanks Cotlim)
- Fixed so "Start multiplayer" will now always automatically start a console session
- Fixed log bloat from messages from dnlib/publicizer which were showing no useful data (thanks Cotlim)
- ...More misc features and bug fixes, this mod hasn't been updated in more than 6 months, I hope nothing breaks with this update (v1.1)...
